title: "I like the way Aquamacs looks. I don't use it because it feels different."

One of the many reasons I use Emacs is because it gets rid 
of the "which editor do I use on this OS" problem for me. 
I'm constantly switching between multiple operating systems
and having to remember different key-bindings, different
functionality, and different user interfaces for different
editors and operating system is a major pain. Yes, I prefer
the keyboard to the mouse even on OS X. It boils down to:

> Emacs allows me to memorize only on set of keyboard shortcuts.

Now, I could use [Aquamacs][aquamacs] on OS X, but I don't really think it
fits my tiny brain. GNU Emacs, on the other hand, gives me the
same familiar classic feeling of using it on, say a Linux. Also,
accessing Aquamacs from the terminal to do a batch compile
of elips modules is equivalent to tying your hair to a horse's
tail and letting the horse gallop free! Aquamacs does not use
the standard Emacs options and breaks builds for various packages.

I ended up removing Aquamacs and installed [Emacs for Mac OS X][emacsformacosx]. 
Sadly, symlinking it and using it in the Terminal was easier, 
but batch-compiling proved to be a major failure.

Therefore, I decided to do this the good way——compile it from source.
You need the Mac OS X developer tools installed before you do any 
of this. Oh, and you need [git][git].

    $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
    $ cd emacs
    
### GNU Emacs for the GUI

    $ ./configure --with-ns      # <-- No --prefix=...
    $ make bootstrap
    $ make -j4
    $ make install               # Yes, *without* sudo.
    $ sudo cp -r nextstep/Emacs.app /Applications/Emacs.app
    
### GNU Emacs for the Terminal

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-x   # <-- with the --prefix=...
    $ make bootstrap
    $ make -j4
    $ sudo make install          # *with* sudo.

If you don't include a `--prefix` argument to the `configure` script
and use the `--with-ns` option, the application bundle will be built
when you type `make install` instead of actually installing on your
system. On the other hand, using `configure` with the `--with-ns` 
option means you want `make install` to install a command line version
of Emacs.

All set!
