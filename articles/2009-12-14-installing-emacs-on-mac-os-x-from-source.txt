description: "Installing GNU Emacs from source code on Mac OS X."

One of the many reasons I use Emacs is because it gets rid 
of the "Which editor do I use on this OS?" problem for me. 
I'm constantly switching between multiple operating systems
and having to remember different key-bindings, different
functionality, and different user interfaces for different
editors and operating systems is a major pain. Yes, I prefer
the keyboard to the mouse even on OS X. It boils down to:

Now, I could use [Aquamacs][] on OS X, and I tried.

But it's like jelly and doesn't fit my tiny brain. Accessing 
Aquamacs from the terminal to do a batch compilation of [Elisp][] 
modules is equivalent to tying your hair to a horse's tail 
and letting the horse gallop right ahead!

I ended up removing Aquamacs and installed 
[Emacs for Mac OS X][emacsformacosx]. Sadly, symlinking it in 
the Terminal was easier, but broken batch-compiling proved to be 
a downside.

Therefore, I decided to do this the good wayâ€”the way good 
programmers do.

You will need the [Mac OS X developer tools][xcode] installed before 
you do any of this. Oh, and as is apparent, you will need 
[git][git]. So, without further ado let's:

### Grab the Emacs source code

    $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
    $ cd emacs
    
### Emacs for the GUI

    $ ./configure --with-ns      # <-- No --prefix=...
    $ make bootstrap
    $ make -j4
    $ make install               # Yes, *without* sudo.
    $ sudo cp -r nextstep/Emacs.app /Applications/Emacs.app
    
### Emacs for the Terminal

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-x   # <-- with the --prefix=...
    $ make bootstrap
    $ make -j4
    $ sudo make install          # *with* sudo.

If you don't include the `--prefix` option to the `configure` script
and use the `--with-ns` option, the application bundle will be built
when you type `make install` instead of actually installing anything 
on your system. On the other hand, using `configure` with the 
`--with-ns` option means you want `make install` to install a 
command-line version of Emacs.

All set!
